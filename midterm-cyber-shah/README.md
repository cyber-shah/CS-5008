## Overview

Fibonacci series is something quite evident everywhere around us. It's in nature.
It is the fundamental for golden ratio, again found everywhere around us.
it is so evident and also beautiful that it's referred as finger print of god.

Hence, it is something that humans have always been fascinated about and looked for different ways to solve it over the years.

This report focuses on the analysis of the fibonacci series. Mathematically it is defined as a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
Hence the nth fibonacci number is given by the formula:
> Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

The simplest is the series:
> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13..


Broadly there are two ways to solve it, iterative and recursive
